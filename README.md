# Library-Analytics-Project
A python project made in class 12 to analyze reading habits using two csv datasets. It demonstrates how core programming concepts like file handling, loop, conditional logic, and menu driven programes can be applied to process and interpret real world data.

# University Library Data Analyzer â€“ Class 12 Python Project

This project was created as part of my Class 12 Computer Science curriculum to demonstrate how core programming concepts can be applied to real-world data scenarios using Python.

## Overview

The project analyzes the reading habits and genre preferences of students from two sample universities. Using four CSV files (two for genre preferences and two for reading habits), the program performs a variety of operations through a menu-driven interface.

## Features

### 1. Data Loading and Display
- Loads four CSV tables: 
  - Genre Preferences (University A and B)
  - Reading Habits (University A and B)
- Displays all tables for user reference

### 2. Data Statistics
- View table metadata and structure:
  - Transpose
  - Column names
  - Index
  - Shape & Dimension
  - Data types
  - Size
- View specific record slices:
  - Top 5 / Bottom 5 records
  - Specific number of records from top/bottom
  - Genre-wise or habit-wise details

### 3. Insertion
- Add new records to the dataset

### 4. Updation
- Update existing records in the CSV files

### 5. Deletion
- Remove specific records from the dataset

### 6. Data Visualization
- Generate charts and graphs (e.g., bar chart, pie chart) to visualize genre preferences and reading trends for both universities

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- File handling with CSV
- Loops and conditional logic
- Menu-driven programming
- Data manipulation using Pandas
- Data visualization using Matplotlib
- Real-world data analysis and reporting

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- CSV files
